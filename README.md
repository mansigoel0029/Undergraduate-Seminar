# Undergraduate-Seminar

This is an undergraduate level course at Shiv Nadar University. As a part of this course, we had to give three presentations on topics related to the field we want to pursue. The first presentation was on a familiar topic studied in any course and for the other two presentations, students had to choose a mentor and a research paper of interest, understand the concepts of the paper deeply and present it in our own words. The presentations are prepared from stratch in LaTex

This repository contains 3 presentations, their LaTex files and the referenced research papers:
1. Bias-Variance Trade-Off 
2. Assignment Problem
3. Privacy Preserving Linear Programming
